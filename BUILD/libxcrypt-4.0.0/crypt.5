.SH NAME
crypt \- storage format for hashed passphrases and available hashing methods
.SH DESCRIPTION
The hashing methods implemented by
.BR crypt (3)
are designed only to process user passphrases for storage and authentication;
they are not suitable for use as general-purpose cryptographic hashes.
.PP
Passphrase hashing is not a replacement for strong passphrases.
It is always possible
for an attacker with access to the hashed passphrases
to guess and check possible cleartext passphrases.
However, with a strong hashing method,
guessing will be too slow for the attacker
to discover a strong passphrase.
.PP
All of the hashing methods use a \(lqsalt\(rq to perturb the hash function,
so that the same passphrase may produce many possible hashes.
Newer methods accept longer salt strings.
The salt should be chosen at random for each user.
Salt defeats a number of attacks:
.TP
1.
It is not possible to hash a passphrase once
and then test it against each account's stored hash;
the hash calculation must be repeated for each account.
.TP
2.
Tables of precalculated hashes of commonly used passphrases
must have an entry for each possible salt,
which makes them impractically large.
.TP
3.
It is not possible to tell whether two accounts use the same passphrase
without successfully guessing one of the phrases.
.PP
All of the hashing methods are also deliberately engineered to be slow;
they use many iterations of an underlying cryptographic primitive
to increase the cost of each guess.
The newer hashing methods allow the number of iterations to be adjusted,
using the \(lqCPU time cost\(rq parameter to
.BR crypt_gensalt (3).
This makes it possible to keep the hash slow as hardware improves.
.SH FORMAT OF HASHED PASSPHRASES
All of the hashing methods supported by
.I libcrypt
produce a hashed passphrase which consists of four components:
.IR prefix ", " options ", " salt ", and " hash.
The prefix controls which hashing method is to be used, and is the
appropriate string to pass to
.B crypt_gensalt
to select that method.
The contents of
.IR options ", " salt ", and " hash
are up to the method.
Depending on the method, the
.IR prefix " and " options
components may be empty.
.PP
The
.I setting
argument to
.B crypt
must begin with the first three components of a valid hashed passphrase,
but anything after that is ignored.
This makes authentication simple:
hash the input passphrase using the stored passphrase as the setting,
and then compare the result to the stored passphrase.
.PP
Hashed passphrases are always entirely printable ASCII,
and do not contain any whitespace
or the characters \(oq\fB:\fR\(cq,
\(oq\fB;\fR\(cq,
\(oq\fB*\fR\(cq,
\(oq\fB!\fR\(cq, or
\(oq\fB\e\fR\(cq.
(These characters are used as delimiters and special markers in the
.BR passwd (5)
and
.BR shadow (5)
files.)
.PP
The syntax of each component of a hashed passphrase
is up to the hashing method.
\(oq\fB$\fR\(cq characters
usually delimit components,
and the salt and hash are usually encoded as numerals in base 64.
However, the details of the base-64 encoding vary among hashing
methods and are usually
.I not
compatible with the common \(lqbase64\(rq encoding.
.SH AVAILABLE HASHING METHODS
This is a list of
.I all
the hashing methods supported by
.IR libcrypt ,
in decreasing order of strength.
Many of the older methods
are now considered too weak to use for new passphrases.
The encoded passphrase format is expressed
with extended regular expressions (see
.BR regex (7))
and does not show the division into prefix, options, salt, and hash.

.B bcrypt
.br
A hash based on the Blowfish block cipher,
modified to have an extra-expensive key schedule.
Originally developed by Niels Provos and David Mazieres for OpenBSD
and also supported on recent versions of FreeBSD and NetBSD,
on Solaris 10 and newer, and on several GNU/*/Linux distributions.
Recommended for new password hashes.
.hash "$2b$" "\e$2[abxy]\e$[0-9]{2}\e$[./A-Za-z0-9]{53}" 72 8 "" 184 128 "4 to 31 (logarithmic)"
.PP
bcrypt hashes originally used the "$2a$" prefix.
However, in 2011 an implementation bug was discovered in crypt_blowfish
(versions up to 1.0.4 inclusive) affecting handling of password characters with
the 8th bit set.
Besides fixing the bug,
to provide for upgrade strategies for existing systems, two new prefixes were
introduced: "$2x$", which fully re-introduces the bug, and "$2y$", which
guarantees correct handling of both 7- and 8-bit characters.
OpenBSD 5.5 introduced the "$2b$" prefix for behavior that exactly matches
crypt_blowfish's "$2y$", and current crypt_blowfish supports it as well.
Unfortunately, the behavior of "$2a$" on password characters with the 8th bit
set has to be considered system-specific.
When generating new password hashes, the "$2b$" or "$2y$" prefix should be used.
(If such hashes ever need to be migrated to a system that does not yet support
these new prefixes, the prefix in migrated copies of the already-generated
hashes may be changed to "$2a$".)
.PP
.ti -4
.B SHA-2-512
.br
A hash based on SHA-2 with 512-bit output, originally developed by
Ulrich Drepper for GNU libc.
Supported on Linux but not common elsewhere.
Acceptable for new password hashes.
The default CPU time cost parameter is 5000, which is too low for
modern hardware.
.br
.hash "$6$" "\e$6\e$(rounds=[0-9]+\e$)?[^$]{1,16}\e$[./0-9A-Za-z]{86}" unlimited 8 512 512 "6 to 96" "1000 to 999,999,999"
.PP
.ti -4
.B SHA-2-256
.br
A hash based on SHA-2 with 256-bit output, originally developed by
Ulrich Drepper for GNU libc.
Supported on Linux but not common elsewhere.
Acceptable for new password hashes.
The default CPU time cost parameter is 5000, which is too low for
modern hardware.
.br
.hash "$5$" "\e$5\e$(rounds=[0-9]+\e$)?[^$]{1,16}\e$[./0-9A-Za-z]{43}" unlimited 8 256 256 "6 to 96" "1000 to 999,999,999"
.PP
.ti -4
.B MD5
.br
A hash based on the MD5 algorithm, originally developed by
Poul-Henning Kamp for FreeBSD.
Supported on most free Unixes and newer versions of Solaris.
Not as weak as the DES-based hashes below,
but due to the weak cryptographic primitive at its heart
and the fixed CPU time cost
(which is already much too low)
it should not be used for new hashes.
.hash "$1$" "\e$1\e$[^$]{1,8}\e$[./0-9A-Za-z]{22}" unlimited 8 128 128 "6 to 48" 1000
.PP
.ti -4
.B BSDI extended DES
.br
This is another weak extension of traditional DES,
which eliminates the length limit,
increases the salt size,
and makes the time cost tunable.
It originates with BSDI
and is also available on at least NetBSD, OpenBSD, and FreeBSD
due to the use of David Burren's FreeSec library.
It is better than bigcrypt and traditional DES,
but still should not be used for new hashes.
.hash _ "_[./0-9A-Za-z]{19}" unlimited 7 56 64 24 "1 to 2**24-1 (must be odd)"
.PP
.ti -4
.B bigcrypt
.br
This is a weak extension of traditional DES,
available on some System V-derived Unixes.
All it does is raise the length limit from 8 to 128 characters.
It should not be used for new hashes.
.hash "" "[./0-9A-Za-z]{13,178}" 128 7 "up to 896" "up to 1024" 12 25
.PP
.ti -4
.B Traditional DES-based
.br
This method is supported by almost all implementations of
.BR crypt .
Because it is based on a weak cipher primitive,
because there are only 4096 possible salts and 2**56 possible hashes,
and especially because it truncates passphrases to 8 characters,
it no longer offers adequate security for new passphrases.
It should only be used if you absolutely have to generate hashes
that will work on an old operating system that supports nothing else.
.hash "" "[./0-9A-Za-z]{13}" 8 7 56 64 12 25
